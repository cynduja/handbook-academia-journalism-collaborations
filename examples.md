Measure of America requested and analyzed data from the New York City Department of Education to develop a custom dataset that presents graduation rates by the types of high school programs students are admitted to. The researchers worked with the reporters over the course of a year to analyze the data for both the Times story and [a research report](http://www.measureofamerica.org/who-graduates/).

[Diversity in Silicon Valley](https://www.revealnews.org/article/heres-the-clearest-picture-of-silicon-valleys-diversity-yet/)

It's almost impossible to get hard numbers on diversity in technology companies unless they choose to disclose them. Companies report these numbers to the federal government every year, but agencies collecting this data don't share this data with the public for various reasons. In a collaboration with the Center for Employment Equity at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Reveal acquired anonymized diversity [data](https://github.com/cirlabs/Silicon-Valley-Diversity-Data) for 177 of the largest technology companies in Silicon Valley. The Center for Employment Equity co-published a [technical report](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b205de896e76fd6f1b8fdd3/t/5b315a22352f535d36ead46f/1529960995326/2018-Diversity+in+Silicon+Valley+Tech-Final.pdf) as a part of the collaboration. 

[Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/)
An interdisciplinary team including journalists and computer scientists from Stanford University collected police stop data from all over the country, analyzed the dataset and open-sourced it for others to use.
